                    <p>Wow! The last review of this series. It's been a good run, all. Don't worry, we'll have more
                        reviews coming
                        right up! But first.... let's get to this one. The Keeper's Village! Apparently, the ninja
                        have
                        made the
                        trek through the jungle and finally have stumbled upon their final destination. They're
                        going to
                        grab the
                        final dragon emblem and rescue Cole (how'd Cole get captured in the first place?).</p>
                    <img src="images/jungle/keeper1.jpg">
                    <p>This set is built upon two main "islands." They both include sand and light blue plates on
                        the
                        bottom to
                        simulate the look of what I assume to be some type of structure on a beach, perhaps. Each
                        island
                        contains a
                        lot of details. Floor details and play details. The smaller island includes this sort of
                        see-saw-type
                        contraption, which I assume is supposed to catapult a minifigure. It doesn't have as much
                        leverage as it
                        needs to adequately launch a minifigure into the air, though, so it more or less just causes
                        the
                        minifig to
                        fall over.</p>
                    <p>It also has a stud-launcher which can hold three smooth-top 1x1 rounds at a time. I
                        personally
                        have an
                        unreasonable hatred for stud launchers. I guess I lost too many parts when I was a kid even
                        without stud
                        launchers, so the thought of giving a stud launcher to a kid is basically like giving them
                        vacuum fodder.
                        They're way too easy to lose.</p>
                    <img src="images/jungle/giphy.gif">
                    <p>The other island's play features are great as well. The tower of faces is creepy and ominous,
                        but
                        fun. It
                        comes apart and has mini ball joints for arms (I love mini ball joints, so this is great!).
                    </p>
                    <img src="https://blog.bricksinmotion.com/content/images/2021/04/2.gif">
                    <p>It also has an area for play (or animation! We are on Bricks in Motion after all :P ). The
                        details of the
                        prison and the lava mouth structure are great as well. I only regret that I don't have time
                        to
                        properly
                        light this bad boy up and animate and epic jungle battle on it. (But hey, if you get this
                        set,
                        you can do
                        that and let me know! I'd love to watch it.)</p>
                    <img src="images/jungle//other-features.png">
                    <p>Finally, the minifigs. We've seen all these minifigures in the sets before this... except for
                        Cole. I guess
                        it's part of the story that Cole was captured. He was in prison on the back of the box after
                        all. Cole also
                        has a headband, this time in orange. Cool choice to give him some color by using orange. It
                        fits.</p>
                    <img src="images/jungle/figgies-1.jpg">
                    <p>Wow! That was a lot of reviewing! I had a lot of fun with these sets, and I hope that if you
                        decide to buy
                        any of them, let me know down below and we can discuss them together!</p>
                    <p>Come back later, we've got more reviews on the way. (They're not all NINJAGO, I promise ;) )
