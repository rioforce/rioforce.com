                    <p>On January 1, LEGO is set to release a new line of LEGO Minecraft sets. One notable set in that
                        collection is 21183 The Training Grounds.</p>
                    <p>Unlike many previous Minecraft sets, this set deviates from the vanilla Minecraft design and
                        embraces a more custom-user-based approach. That is, instead of making a set based on a
                        generated cave, structure, or mob, the set is something that a user would have to build in
                        Minecraft to enjoy.</p>
                    <img src="images/minecraft-ninja/image.png">
                    <p>So what makes it different than a regular LEGO set? LEGO Minecraft sets are primarily made of 2x2
                        bricks, of course! Along with that, the minifigures are blocky, as opposed to the traditional
                        round-headed LEGO minifigures. But I assume you already knew that.</p>
                    <p>But how does this set hold up? As a build you can't find in-game, you might assume the audience
                        is rather limited, since not as many shoppers can relate to having a ninja training base in
                        their virtual Minecraft world. I'm also assuming that. When I saw the set, I was a bit confused
                        as to what it was, because I have never seen anything like it related to LEGO Minecraft.</p>
                    <p>Practicality aside, the aesthetics are pretty good. Both the house on top and the cave below have
                        decent detail. Not super detailed, though. My favorite part was probably the bedroom inside. The
                        rest seems mostly lackluster to me.</p>
                    <figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="images/minecraft-ninja/image-3.png">
                        <p>It seems like it would be fun for a 10 year old to play with, though. I remember as a kid I
                            would
                            enjoy strangely sparce sets, like LEGO Indiana Jones 7625: River Chase, which is literally
                            one
                            side of a tree and a couple vehicles.</p>
                        <img src="images/minecraft-ninja/7625-1.jpg">
                        <p>However, I don't think a ten year old would enjoy <em>building</em> this set. Despite the 8+
                            age
                            rating and the functional play features, like the secret trap door in the floor, the set is
                            extremely tedious. </p>
                        <img src="images/minecraft-ninja/image-4.png">
                        <p>Now, this could just be a side effect of the LEGO Minecraft brand. I've never built a LEGO
                            Minecraft set before, but building this felt like I would never be able to "play" with it.
                            Every
                            2x2 brick needed a top, and all the baseplates had to be put together in a special way to
                            support the structure.</p>
                        <p>That's normal, I suppose, but the instructions weren't helping me out at all. I kept getting
                            lost
                            on where I was supposed to place the 30th gray 2x2 brick on the plate full of other ones.
                            Playing spot-the-difference is by far the worst part of building a LEGO set.</p>
                        <img src="images/minecraft-ninja/image-2.png">
                        <p>So, unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the building or result of this set. Maybe my attention span
                            is
                            less than that of an 8 year old, but I can't imagine a child actually finishing this set to
                            even
                            play with it as the instructions want.</p>
                        <p>But what did I like?</p>
                        <p>The minifigures were great. I always enjoy seeing new Minecraft prints. I do have a few
                            Minecraft
                            minifigures, and they have cool designs! There were a good assortment of parts and weapons
                            too.
                            This will be happily added to my brick collection.</p>
                        <p>I also really liked the pink bricks used for the roof. I've never seen that pepto-bismol pink
                            before, so that was a nice surprise.</p>
                        <img src="images/minecraft-ninja//image-1.png">
                        <p>I think if you're into LEGO Minecraft, or ninjas, you migt have an entirely different opinion
                            than me on this set. You may think this set would be a great addition to your LEGO Minecraft
                            room-sized diorama you're planning to build when your older brother moves out and you get
                            his
                            room. Or maybe you agree with me. Either way, thse are just my opinions! All LEGO has some
                            value, even if the instructions and picture on the box don't provide it to you.</p>
                        <p>That's all, folks!</p>
